## Description

E-Commerce back end is an application which is used to demonstrate the use of routes for updating an 'e-commerce' database. In this instance the database is for an inventory of products for sale on an online store. However, the framework used for this application could be altered and used for a database of anything. 

## Installation

The technologies used include MySQL, Express, Dotenv and Sequelize.

## Usage

This application is designed to work in an e-commerce setting but can be applied to any company with a need for organizing products. More broadly the models can be altered to be applied to any services or goods as well as any database needs.
